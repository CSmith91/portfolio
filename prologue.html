                    <p class="drop-cap">THE NIGHT'S BREEZE drifted through the peaceful quarters of the emperor’s palace, but Nyona couldn’t sleep knowing the last person who went against Stanlee Hanwen disappeared on a similarly calm night. It was also far from tranquil beyond the lofty, scab-coloured walls of Arzyrdong. Wizards openly rebelled against them.
                    </p><p>She lay on her bed and stared at the chamber door. Friend or foe would open it at any moment, and she would know her fate. The hinges groaned in a soft whisper as the hardwood swung into a black corridor. 
                    </p><p>“Fifth Concubine Nyona,” a voice called from the shadow.
                    </p><p>Nyona clutched her silk blankets. <i>Would an assassin say my full title? Do I answer back or pretend to be asleep?</i> She waited, frozen like a sparrow before a diving hawk. The figure pulled a document from their robe.
                    </p><p>“We got it,” Old Hwung said. “Proof Stanlee’s lying to the emperor.”
                    </p><p>“And no one saw you?” Nyona said. “Stanlee uses magic to watch folk.”
                    </p><p>“The elder spends more time pushing out a piss than crafting spells, Your Beauty. Ehe! No man, spirit or demon saw me.”
                    </p><p>Nyona sank into her cotton-stuffed mattress. She bid her guard goodnight and tried to get some rest because, come morning, she’d defy Stanlee openly before her husband, Emperor Zhato. 
                    </p><p>Sleep didn’t come. She had the evidence she needed, but now she had to get her point across. <i>And folk will refute it. Refute </i>me.
                    </p><p>Dawn brought a mist that bathed the palace in a pale light. Her maids countered the dullness by dressing her in a flowing, pleated skirt embroidered with the creatures of the four spans. Vivid shades of vermillion, gold and aquamarine coloured the mighty dragon, the glorious phoenix, the mystical turtle and the foreboding oxhorse. The silk clung to her sweat, worsened by her servants’ nervous tugs and zealous adjustments.
                    </p><p>“Emperor Zhato will listen to me,” Nyona said.
                    </p><p>“He always listens to you,” her maid said. “But you’ve never spoken against any one in his court before, let alone the elder sorcerer.”
                    </p><p>Old Hwung grunted beyond the screen. “That scholar went against him, remember? She and her household are gone now. Apparently, they were ‘washed out to sea’. Huh. Who here can magic-up an ‘unforeseeable storm’, eh?”
                    </p><p>“Stanlee wouldn’t dare touch his emperor’s concubine or her household,” Nyona said. “Especially when we’re all at the mercy of the wizards out <i>there</i>.”
                    </p><p>“Aye!” Old Hwung said. “We had the revolt in Galyglo not long ago. Wizards ran from house to house, pulled men and women out of their homes, beheaded them and paraded their heads on spikes!”
                    </p><p><i>And to prevent that happening again, I need to go against everything I’ve been taught</i>. Heat rose from within her chest. She fanned her reddened cheeks. <i>You mustn’t break, you mustn’t cave in to that feeling in your gut</i>.
                    </p><p>Nyona’s servants brushed her hair, letting it sweep down her neck like fresh ink brushed over paper. A younger girl’s fingers trembled as she secured a jade pin at the back. Nyona cupped the girl’s hands in her own.
                    </p><p>“Focus on getting me dressed and worry of nothing more. We can play a game of Panlin pegs when I return, but only if you promise not to let me win.”
                    </p><p>The girl mustered a fleeting smile as she tightened the concubine’s brocaded girdle.
                    </p><p>“Don’t forget <i>this</i>,” the maid said. She held the sheet of paper they’d stolen that detailed the soldier count of the Emperic army. “If Stanlee lies about the numbers, you can show it to the emperor.”
                    </p><p>“Burn it,” Nyona said. “If I use that as a crutch for my argument, I’ve demonstrated I can’t walk without support.”
                    </p><p>“But…” The maid’s eyes shot to the floor. “Stanlee will say you’re wrong or a liar.”
                    </p><p>“True, but if I show the emperor <i>that</i> document, I’m a thief. It must be burnt.”
                    </p><p>“It will be done,” the maid said. “Good fortune to you, Concubine Nyona.”
                    </p><p>Old Hwung emerged from behind the screen, his head stooped such that the plume of his helmet blocked his aged face. “Do you want me beside you, as reinforcement? I can thud my spear in the meeting, or—”
                    </p><p>“If you’re with me, I’m reminded I’ve devoted myself to this palace as a meek, lovable concubine who does everything she’s told. I mustn’t be swaddled in cotton.”
                    </p><p>“Wait, are you saying <i>I’m</i> cotton?”
                    </p><p>She mustered a true and honest chuckle and left the confines of her chamber, her resolve hardening with each step. The glazed mosaic stone cooled the soles of her silken shoes as she came to the old peach tree. Splayed branches sheltered an elder beneath, who gazed wistfully at the offices and chambers surrounding them.
                    </p><p>“Good morning, Stanlee Hanwen,” Nyona said with a low bow.
                    </p><p>The elder’s dirty grey beard twitched. He cupped a hand around one of his giant ears that drooped beneath what remained of his jawline. His other wrinkled, hairless hand leant on a polegrass cane that wobbled as he steadied himself. Stanlee was well over a hundred years old, kept alive by his magic, but Nyona didn’t know his precise age or how many emperors and empresses he’d served. 
                    </p><p>“You know the peach tree <i>still</i> hasn’t bloomed,” he said. 
                    </p><p>“An omen,” Nyona said.
                    </p><p>“An omen? Though I am familiar with the Four Understandings of magic, I never mastered divination. I can tell you what encourages a peach tree to blossom. I can grow a veritable forest of peach trees right before your eyes with my magic, but I cannot say the will of the Heavens.”
                    </p><p>Stanlee looked beyond the branches. The rising sun burnt away the morning mist, leaving a piercing blue sky in its place. The ‘toom’ remained where the stars did not; its white, cavernous swirls were faintly visible from a crescent strip illuminated by the sun. <i>We are insignificant to the Heavens, but I don’t want to die from a sorcerer’s greed</i>. Nyona could only muse as to the elder sorcerer’s thoughts.
                    </p><p>“Apologies,” Stanlee said. 
                    </p><p>He performed a stooped bow and winced as he straightened his barrel-shaped body. Stanlee wore mourning clothes. The silk sash that accompanied the elegant white robe was so fine it reflected the sunlight in true purple, a dye few would see in their lifetime. <i>Death circles Stanlee like a vulture</i>.
                    </p><p>“I’m sorry for your loss, Stanlee,” Nyona said.
                    </p><p>“And I’m sorry I failed our emperor. I tried my best to save Lotusila with every potion, powder and morsel of spellcraft I know, but childbirth is as brutal as battle. The future of my bloodline now falls on a girl of nine.”
                    </p><p>“The Yew Dynasty will endure. We have <i>you</i>, Elder Sorcerer. Your service to Emperor Zhato continues to justify his rule in the eyes of the realm’s subjects.”
                    </p><p>He cocked his head, the bun of white hair atop tilting like a rolling snowball. “I’m sure, therefore, you’d agree I know what’s best for us, given all I’ve seen and all I know?”
                    </p><p>Nyona’s throat caught. <i>The fight has already started</i>. 
                    </p><p>“This palace must heed the advice of our elder sorcerer,” Nyona said, “but our empire is large and our foe is dangerous. We are only strong united and with the help of our vassals, who benefit from the outstanding central governance of Arzyrdong.”
                    </p><p>Stanlee’s cold hand grabbed her arm and pinched tight.
                    </p><p>“You aren’t going against me, I trust?” he said. “That wouldn’t be fitting of a palace concubine—certainly not one we all regard so highly.”
                    </p><p>He spoke softly, yet it cut deep. Nyona’s knees wobbled as they yearned to crook into a curtsey. The flush in her cheeks offered her the grace to apologise and escape to her chamber, practice her singing, music, calligraphy and storytelling. <i>Just as it was in my youth</i>. Even now, as the middle-aged mother of the heir to the Zjudic Empire, she wanted to hear praise and see smiles. 
                    </p><p>“I go against no one but the rebels,” Nyona said, “and wish to express my thoughts as much as gleam wisdom from your insights before our emperor.”
                    </p><p>“A concubine choosing debate over whispers behind screens is… <i>admirable</i>,” Stanlee said. He released his grip on her. “Shall we?”
                    </p><p>They entered the east side of the Illustrious Building, guarded by stone statues depicting the creatures of the four spans, their carvings of similar design to the embroidery on Nyona’s skirt. 
                    </p><p>The Hall of the Rampant Tiger opened out to a lone throne before mats and awaiting servants. <i>I’m going against Stanlee Hanwen</i>. She was surely a fool for disagreeing with someone so venerable and almighty; no other courtiers wanted to witness their debate, let alone partake. Nyona and Stanlee knelt upon the mats closest to the emperor and waited.
                    </p><p>Her heart beat in her skull. <i>You’re doing this for your household and your empire. For setting right and wrong</i>. 
                    </p><p>Emperor Zhato emerged in a golden gown that enshrouded a black silk robe as slick and shimmering as oil. The orbs that dangled from his mortar-board crown partially concealed his face. Runic metal nullified magic, meaning the nine beaded rows front and back protected the emperor should Stanlee Hanwen – or any everyday ‘wizard’ – ever try anything. <i>You can’t beguile him with magic, Stanlee. You’re stuck with a mouth and a tongue like me</i>.
                    </p><p>“Iskander Osang defies our empire and is in open rebellion,” Emperor Zhato said, his soft voice croaking. “But I hear my own court is in division as to what should be done.”
                    </p><p>Stanlee stood from his mat. “Your Impericy, with the death of Lotusila, Iskander thinks our dynasty is weak and so rebels. Your army, led by my great-nephew, will crush him and prove him wrong.”
                    </p><p>Emperor Zhato nodded. The beaded curtain obscuring his face <i>clink</i>ed like a bag of pearls. “Does Concubine Nyona disagree?”
                    </p><p>“No, Your Impericy,” Nyona said, rising from her mat. She did disagree. Completely and utterly. But you never said something so direct. “However, our army is not strong enough to defeat a wizard as powerful as Iskander Osang. We must raise a call to arms across the entire empire.”
                    </p><p>Stanlee said, “Creating a coalition will make every eastern noble, southern scholar and western warlord want a say in how matters are conducted—especially where magic is concerned. The governance of magic is delicate, and given the delicacy in the palace right now, we must quash Iskander with our own men.”
                    </p><p>The weight of Nyona’s argument pressed on her shoulders. “And if we lose?” she asked, her voice steady but her hands shaking. “We’ll look even weaker to those ‘eastern nobles, southern scholars and western warlords’. We need to put out the call to arms while we’re strong.”
                    </p><p>“Iskander Osang is a rash dolt,” Stanlee said. He hobbled down the symmetrical rows of unoccupied mats that sat on both sides of a long, narrow carpet. The coastal wind filled the airy hall with the elder’s floral perfume. “Your Impericy, I know magic like no other. I assure you, our army will crush him.”
                    </p><p>“I would not underestimate the Grand Mage of the Institute of Spellcraft,” Nyona said. “Revered and learned wizards voted Iskander their leader. If he can sway a council, he can sway folk to join his rebellion.”
                    </p><p>“Not enough to pose a threat to the emperor’s army. My great-nephew Jereman is trained to combat magic—trained by <i>me</i>.” Stanlee returned to his place beside Nyona and set his milky-brown eyes on her. “Dearest Fifth Concubine Nyona, you mustn’t fear. There’s no reason to argue with an old man like me.”
                    </p><p>The disappointment on his face stung almost as much as his tone of voice. Her cheek burnt as if ‘uncouth concubine’ was needled onto her flesh like a criminal mark. <i>We can’t do this alone</i>. She remembered the wizards overrunning the southern city. <i>We needed a coalition to stop</i> those <i>wizards</i>. Iskander rebelled closer to home. The province of South Laboris touched their home province of Imperia. <i>If Jereman Hanwen fails, Iskander will come for all of us</i>.
                    </p><p>“Your Impericy,” Nyona said, “you are wise and intelligent, taking schemes offered by your advisors beyond the spans they’re considered. I know not what future you see nor what future you desire, but I see a present that holds an Emperic army shrunken from the Blight. The realm will unite to quell these spellcrafters if the call is made. It will tell <i>all</i> wizards across the realm never to revolt again. I beg you listen.”
                    </p><p>Emperor Zhato stroked his long, straight beard from jaw to rib and tapped his free thumb on his red and white sash. <i>I could say that others fear speaking against Stanlee Hanwen, and that I know the true numbers of our army</i>. She bit her lip. <i>No, that would nullify everything I’ve said, like magic in the presence of runic metal</i>.
                    </p><p>“I’ll make my final decision on the morrow,” Emperor Zhato said, leaving the hall.
                    </p><p>Both courtiers bowed to their departing emperor. Nyona, who never thought she’d argue with the most powerful sorcerer – the only living sorcerer – in the world, released a careful sigh and withheld a smile. <i>I think I’ve convinced the emperor</i>. Never forgetting her manners, she bowed to her opponent. 
                    </p><p>“This lowly concubine bids you good day, Elder Sorcerer.”
                    </p><p>Stanlee gave another wrinkled smile. “Let’s see what the morrow brings, Concubine Nyona.” He held her arm, squeezing just a little too tight. “Though I can’t always foresee the weather.”
